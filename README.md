### <strong>ðŸ’¡ Infos about this code</strong>

The code you'll find here is generated from [this template](https://github.com/rahi-khan/npx_card).
And the template was created, by tewaking [another repo](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card).
Even that repo was not 100% original but instead created using [this guide](https://studioelsa.se/blog/open-source-oss-npx-business-card/) by [@jackboreg](https://github.com/jackboberg/).
And who knows who gave Jack the inspiration to create that guide.

You get where I'm going with this.
All of this basically means that the Business Card type of presentation was never my original idea.
I just took other people's code and personalized it for my taste.

If you are going to do the same, just remember to credit anyone that you forked the repo from. Might it be [me](https://github.com/Croluy) or [Rahi Khan](https://github.com/rahi-khan/) or [Anmol098](https://github.com/anmol098/) or [Jack Boreg](https://github.com/jackboberg) or anyone else.

Thank you ðŸŒŸ
