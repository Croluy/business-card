### <strong>ðŸ’¡ Some infos about this code</strong>

The code you will find here is generated from [this template](https://github.com/rahi-khan/npx_card).
And that template was created, by tewaking [this repo](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card).
Even that repo is not 100% original but instead created using [this guide](https://studioelsa.se/blog/open-source-oss-npx-business-card/) by [@jackboreg](https://github.com/jackboberg/).
And who knows who gave Jack the inspiration to create that guide.

You get where I'm going.
All of this basically means the Business Card type of project isn't my original idea.
I just took other people's code and put effort in order to personalize it for my taste.

If you are going to do the same, just make sure to credit anyone whom you will fork the repo from. Might it be me ([croluy](https://github.com/Croluy)) or [Rahi Khan](https://github.com/rahi-khan/) or [Anmol098](https://github.com/anmol098/) or [Jack Boreg](https://github.com/jackboberg) or anyone else.

Thank you ðŸŒŸ
