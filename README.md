<strong>If you have <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> installed, you can connect with me directly via a terminal command.</strong>

### <strong>ðŸ‘‡ Write this in your terminal</strong>

```bash
npx croluy@latest
```

*If it's the first time you run this command or if I have recently updated this package, you will be asked if you want to install the newest version. You should accept that.*

### <strong>ðŸ’¡ Some infos about this code</strong>

The code you will find here was initially generated from [this template](https://github.com/beyourahi/npx_card).
And that template was created, by tewaking [this repo](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card).
Even that repo is not 100% original but instead created using [this guide](https://studioelsa.se/blog/open-source-oss-npx-business-card/) by [@jackboreg](https://github.com/jackboberg/).
And who knows who gave Jack the inspiration to create that guide.

You get where I'm going.
All of this basically means the Business Card type of project isn't my original idea.
I just took other people's code and put a decent amount of effort in order to personalize it for my own taste.

If you are going to do the same, just make sure to credit anyone whom you will fork the repo from. Might it be me ([croluy](https://github.com/Croluy)) or [Beyourahi](https://github.com/beyourahi) or [Anmol098](https://github.com/anmol098/) or [Jack Boreg](https://github.com/jackboberg).

Thank you ðŸŒŸ
